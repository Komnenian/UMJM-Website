The recently built HSC Women’s Hospital was designed with patient-centered care in mind. Many of the design elements used in the hospital are rooted in current evidence on how the physical environment impacts patient health outcomes and satisfaction. Some notable changes include improved air quality through using 100% circulating fresh air, inclusion of nature and wildlife elements in interior design, and adoption of single patient rooms throughout the hospital.
