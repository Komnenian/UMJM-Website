<p>In this paper, I argue that the release of cohort-specific class averages through the Examplify<sup>TM</sup> scoring reports do not adequately encourage development of the Scholar role within the CanMEDS framework. Specifically, I argue that the release of cohort-specific class averages in their current format encourages students to focus on more individual metrics, thus dissuading students from participating in more collaborative efforts to generate collective improvements in practice.</p>
