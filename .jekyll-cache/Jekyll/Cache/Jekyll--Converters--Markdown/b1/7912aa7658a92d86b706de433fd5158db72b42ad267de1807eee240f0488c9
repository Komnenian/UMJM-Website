<p>“Do you have research experience?”, “What are your plans for the summer?”, and “How important is research?”. These are questions which many 1st and 2nd year medical students may come across. Already, medical students have a strong interest in research. A 2014 Canadian survey polled students at the Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine, and discovered that 89% of students had previous research experience. While student research participation may vary from school to school, perceived barriers to student involvement in research persist. These often include a lack of time, unfamiliarity with the research process and absence of knowledge related to seeking research opportunities. This commentary will discuss what research in pre-clerkship can look like, tips on the research process, the importance of research for medical students, and how to boost student involvement in research.</p>
